Classes are used to group items and ids are used to manipulate one individual item.

Width, In-line/In-line Block, Margin, Padding, and Borders are all really popular 
CSS property used today, 

I've personally used in-line styling to edit photos the size of a photo or iframe from 
another source, external/internal style sheets ar commonly used because it's more 
effective to use when you have so much css on your page.
